# Daily Logs – Blacknet AI Builder's Journal

Hey there!

Welcome to my daily task zone — a cozy little corner of the Blacknet AI project where I jot down what I’m building, thinking, and planning each day.

This folder holds:
- **Daily markdown files** like ![May-4.md](May-4.md), `May-5.md`, etc.
- Snapshots of my progress as I design and develop the Blacknet AI engine
- Logs of ideas, decisions, and reflections
- A trail of thoughts from prototype to something powerful

## Why this exists?

Building an AI assistant from scratch isn’t a walk in the park (even with a neural net at your side). This log helps:
- Keep track of progress
- Stay focused on small, achievable tasks
- Celebrate the little wins along the way

---

## What I’m working on (currently):

- Developing the **task-based prototype** for Blacknet AI’s digital assistant
- Focusing on **symptom analysis and triage logic**
- Designing the AI’s core brain: intent decoder, response administrator, and memory system

## How to read this

Each `.md` file = one day of focused building.
Open any date to peek into the process — it’s like a dev diary, but with more AI and less coffee stains.

Thanks for stopping by!
