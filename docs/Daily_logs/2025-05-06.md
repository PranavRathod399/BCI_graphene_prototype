Progress Log â€“ Symptom Triage Analyzer

What was done:

Completed integration of health care advice system into the analyzer pipeline.

Home care advice is now shown only for mild/moderate symptoms.

Emergency/Severe cases trigger a 911 or healthcare contact referral.


Finalized a clean interactive version of analyze_input() pipeline.

Uploaded the current notebook to PDF format for archival/testing.

Reviewed limitations in the current implementation.

Documented 6 major categories of drawbacks for future iterations.

Planned to address these issues alongside longer-term vision.



Current Limitations:

Narrow symptom coverage

No synonym or typo detection

Hardcoded scoring and advice

No user input validation or clarification

No personalization (age, vitals, etc.)


Next Steps:

Improve symptom detection with NLP (synonyms, typos)

Add confidence scoring and validation

Begin session memory or stateful interaction tracking
