## Progress Log â€“ Symptom Triage Analyzer

### What was done:  [V-2_symptom_triage_analyzer](../../code/blacknet/V-2_symptom_triage_analyzer.ipynb)
- Completed integration of health care advice system into the analyzer pipeline.
  - Home care advice is now shown only for mild/moderate symptoms.
  - Emergency/Severe cases trigger a 911 or healthcare contact referral.
- Finalized a clean interactive version of `analyze_input()` pipeline.
- Reviewed limitations in the current implementation.
- Documented 6 major categories of drawbacks for future iterations.
- Planned to address these issues alongside longer-term vision.

### Current Limitations:
- Narrow symptom coverage  
- No synonym or typo detection  
- Hardcoded scoring and advice  
- No user input validation or clarification  
- No personalization (age, vitals, etc.)

---

### Next Steps:
- Improve symptom detection with NLP (synonyms, typos)  
- Add confidence scoring and validation  
- Begin session memory or stateful interaction tracking
