## Update: Return from Exam Break

After a focused two-week break to prepare and appear for the **JEE Advanced** exam, I’m now fully committed to resuming full-time development on **Project Blacklace** and the **Blacknet AI engine**.

Though I wasn’t actively building during this time, the break helped me consolidate my long-term vision and return with more clarity and energy.
