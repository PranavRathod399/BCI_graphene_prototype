## Summary

Today, I focused on designing the core architecture for the **Blacknet AI Digital Assistant** (medical sector). The main goal was to break down the prototype into task-based modules that simulate symptom parsing, context handling, and triage response.

## Key Accomplishments

- Designed the high-level **framework** for the AI intent decoder and response administrator.
- Defined 7 core components:
  - Symptom Input Interface
  - NLP Symptom Parser
  - Context Memory System
  - Triage Logic Module
  - Output Response Generator
  - Medical Data Storage
  - Control Flow Orchestrator
- Planned modular Python structure and task breakdown.
- Chose to delay MVP and focus on **task-based prototyping** first.

## Next Steps

- Finalize a list of 10–20 core symptoms to support. (completed) 
- Start coding the NLP parser and triage rule engine. (completed)
- Create the data folder with mild treatment examples and escalation flags.

## Reflections

Building the framework clarified the path forward. The modular approach will allow me to test and refine each part before bundling them into an MVP.
