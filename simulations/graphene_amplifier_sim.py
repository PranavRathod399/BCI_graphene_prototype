Graphene Amplifier Simulation â€“ Placeholder Module
--------------------------------------------------

This file will simulate the behavior of a graphene-based signal amplifier,
mimicking its high conductivity and noise-resistance properties.

The goal is to enhance raw EEG signals for better readability by AI decoding systems.

Development Status: In Progress
