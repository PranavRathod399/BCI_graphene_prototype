## üöÄ Project Overview

This project simulates a next-gen BCI system by integrating:
- Graphene-inspired signal amplification
- Real EEG data from public datasets
- AI models for decoding mental intent into executable commands

The system is designed to aid individuals with **paralysis, speech disorders**, and **mobility impairments** by enabling direct communication from brain to machine‚Äîwithout surgical implants.

## üß™ Scientific Motivation

Inspired by research in **graphene electronics** and breakthroughs in **speech neuroprosthetics**, this project investigates:
- How graphene-like amplification might improve EEG signal fidelity
- How deep learning can decode inner speech or intent from neural signals
- Whether these can be combined into a fully non-invasive BCI pipeline

**Reflection:**  
This phase validated the feasibility of modeling signal amplification through simulated graphene behavior. The signal pipeline and logic now set the stage for **Phase 2: Filtering, Interference Handling, and AI Integration**.

**Note:**  
Phase 2 will also incorporate **real EEG datasets** to evaluate how the amplifier behaves on authentic neural signals, enabling more realistic signal-to-noise analysis and preparing the ground for machine learning integration.

## Phase 2: Real-World Optimization Begins ‚Äî Interference, Noise & AI Filtering

This marks the beginning of **Phase 2** of the BCI Graphene Prototype ‚Äî moving beyond basic signal simulation into real-world constraints and optimization.

### Tackling Interference & Signal Noise

Graphene‚Äôs extreme sensitivity is a double-edged sword. While it can amplify weak brain signals, it‚Äôs also vulnerable to environmental EM noise (WiFi, radio, Bluetooth, etc.).

### Why It Matters
In practical BCI systems, **noise resilience** is critical. This phase explores strategies to ensure the amplifier doesn't get overwhelmed in real-world settings.

### Strategies Explored

- **Signal Isolation & Shielding**  
  Simulated physical protections like **Faraday cages** to block external signals.

- **Frequency Filtering**  
  Implementing **band-pass filters** to isolate neural frequencies (0.5‚Äì100 Hz).

- **Graphene-based Adaptive Filtering**  
  Investigating how graphene‚Äôs tunable conductivity could support *smart*, dynamic filtering.

- **AI-Powered Noise Cancellation**  
  Early-stage conceptual models for training AI to:
  - Distinguish between real brain signals and interference.
  - Adapt filtering over time as environments change.

- **Signal Averaging Techniques**  
  Using multiple time-frame readings to reduce transient noise while preserving meaningful patterns.

### Looking Ahead
This phase forms the bridge between my materials-level amplifier model and the eventual **AI-powered neural decoding** engine.

Stay tuned for Phase 3 ‚Äî integrating learning models with the filtered signal stream.
