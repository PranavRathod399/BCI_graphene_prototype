# 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface Prototype – Simulated Graphene Amplification  
**By Pranav Rathod**

This is an early-stage, independent research project exploring signal preprocessing in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The project simulates **graphene-inspired amplification** to enhance low-voltage neural signals for clearer cognitive intent mapping.

---

## ✨ Background  
Inspired by a 2010s-era talk by Dr. Henderson on the potential of BCIs in early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, this prototype represents a personal initiative to explore affordable and scalable BCI solutions.

Due to limited access to graphene-based materials, this work simulates their signal amplification behavior in code, modeling how they could assist in preprocessing brain signals for improved interpretation.
