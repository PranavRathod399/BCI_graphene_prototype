# Blacklace – Modular BCI Framework
> Decode silent thoughts into action.
> A full-stack Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system engineered from scratch, powered by simulated graphene amplification and modular AI decoding. Designed to function without lab-grade resources, pushing the boundaries of accessible neurotechnology.

## Background & Origin

Blacklace began as an ambitious experiment: to simulate a **graphene-based amplifier** capable of enhancing brainwave signals using open-source tools. Inspired by graphene's sensitivity and potential in bioelectronics, the project aimed to digitally recreate its properties and use that model to amplify low-power EEG signals.

As the simulation evolved, the vision expanded: rather than one monolithic system, Blacklace would become a **modular, end-to-end BCI framework**—flexible enough to slot into existing systems, scalable across different neural signal types, and powerful enough to support AI-driven decoding.

This modular vision gave rise to:
- **Blackjack** – the signal amplifier module
- **Blacknet** – the decoder module

Each piece now operates independently but can integrate into a streamlined pipeline—from raw EEG to AI-understood intent.

Previously this project was named BCI_graphene_prototype now that has give rise to this version you can still read the previous ReadMe in project Blackjack.

## Mission Statement

**Blacklace** is a boundary-pushing brain-computer interface (BCI) architecture that reimagines neural signal acquisition and interpretation through a graphene-inspired amplifier framework and modular AI decoding. 

Born from a fusion of theoretical physics, material science, and cognitive technology, Blacklace aims to build an open, scalable, and biologically-conscious pathway between brain activity and digital systems—unlocking new possibilities for neurotechnology, communication, and human-computer symbiosis.

## System Architecture

Blacklace is structured into three core modules, each serving a distinct function within the BCI pipeline:

### 1. **Blackjack** – Graphene-Based Neural Amplifier
A modular, biologically-aware amplifier designed to boost raw neural signals with minimal distortion. Inspired by the electrical and quantum behavior of graphene, Blackjack aims to create a low-noise, high-gain signal interface between the brain and hardware.

### 2. **Blacknet** – AI-Powered Signal Decoder *(Planned)*
An adaptive neural decoding engine that uses deep learning to interpret amplified brain signals into meaningful output. Blacknet will learn from individual neural patterns, enabling personalized and accurate BCI control.

### 3. **Blacklace** – Integrated BCI Framework
The overarching system that connects Blackjack and Blacknet, handling signal flow, system calibration, and future real-time communication features. Blacklace is designed to be scalable, open-source, and modular—ready to adapt to future research and experimental needs.
